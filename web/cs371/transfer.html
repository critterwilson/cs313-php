		<h2>Transfer of Religion Credit from CES Institutes of Religion and LDS Church Schools</h2>
		<p>Religion credit earned at Church Education System (CES) Institutes of Religion and LDS Church Schools will transfer to BYU-Idaho as an equivalent religion course or elective credit so long as the course is taken for “Church University” or “BYU” credit and such credit is noted on an official Institute/University transcript. Qualifying Religion credit will fulfill both the BYU–Idaho content and resident religion requirement. This policy is primarily designed to benefit BYU–Idaho students who are participating in the online degree programs. Students who are attending BYU–Idaho on-campus are strongly encouraged to register for religion courses offered through BYU–Idaho.</p>
		<h2>Transfer of Credit from BYU Jerusalem Center</h2>
		<p>All courses taken at BYU Jerusalem Center (during a student’s BYU–Idaho experience) will transfer to BYU–Idaho and calculate into the student’s BYU–Idaho GPA.</p>
		<p>Religion courses taken at BYU Jerusalem Center (during a student’s BYU–Idaho experience) will transfer to fulfill both religion course content and the resident religion requirement. However, such credit does not apply to the completion of the overall BYU–Idaho residency requirement. BYU Jerusalem Center credits earned prior to a student’s enrollment at BYU–Idaho can be used to fulfill religion course content only, but may not be applied to any BYU–Idaho residency requirement.</p>
		<h2>Transfer of Religion Credit from Other Universities</h2>
		<p>Coursework in religious studies from any institution other than an LDS Church school or Institute of Religion will not be accepted toward fulfilling the BYU-Idaho religion requirements.</p>
